# üê≥ Immich Auto Stack - Docker Edition

![](images/stacks.png)

This is a simple , yet highly configurable Python script, dressed as a Docker container, that stacks together photos. Immich has stacks, yes. They are not editable through the UI.

By default, it stacks together only **JPG + RAW** files. This behavior can be altered by using a different stacking criteria. Explanation below.

The script can be run manually, or via cronjob by providing a crontab expression to the container. The container can be added to the Immich compose stack directly.

### üîë Obtaining an Immich API key
Instructions can be found in the Immich docs - [Obtain the API key](https://immich.app/docs/features/command-line-interface#obtain-the-api-key)

### üîÇ Running once
To perform a manually triggered run, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -e API_URL="https://immich.mydomain.com/api/" -e API_KEY="xxxxx" -e SKIP_PREVIOUS=True ghcr.io/tenekev/immich-auto-stack:latest /script/immich_auto_stack.py
```

### üîÅ Running on a schedule
```bash
docker run --name immich-auto-stack -e TZ="Europe/Sofia" -e CRON_EXPRESSION="0 * * * *" -e API_URL="https://immich.mydomain.com/api/" -e API_KEY="xxxxx" -e SKIP_PREVIOUS=True ghcr.io/tenekev/immich-auto-stack:latest
```

### üìÉ Running as part of the Immich docker-compose.yml
Adding the container to Immich's `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: "3.8"
...
services:
  immich-server:
    container_name: immich_server
  ...

  immich-auto-stack:
    container_name: immich-auto-stack
    image: ghcr.io/tenekev/immich-auto-stack:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:

      # This is default. Can be omitted. 
      API_URL: http://immich_server:3001/api

      # https://immich.app/docs/features/command-line-interface#obtain-the-api-key
      API_KEY: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

      # Whether or not to modify photos that are already in stacks. Going over all assets takes a lot more time.
      SKIP_PREVIOUS: True

      # This is default. Can be omitted. Read further for customization.
      # CRITERIA: '[{"key": "originalFileName","split": {"key": ".","index": 0}},{"key": "localDateTime"}]'

      # This is default. Can be omitted. If you want to promote other parent criteria like "HDR" or "Edit".
      # PARENT_PROMOTE: ""
      
      # This is default. Can be omitted. 
      # SKIP_MATCH_MISS: False

      # Run every hour. Use https://crontab.guru/ to generate new expressions.
      CRON_EXPRESSION: "0 */1 * * *"
      TZ: Europe/Sofia
```

You can still trigger the script manually by issuing the following command inside the container shell. It will read any relevant environmental variables set during creation.
```sh
/script/immich_auto_stack.py
```
Or with Docker exec:
```sh
docker exec -it immich-auto-stack /script/immich_auto_stack.py
```

## Customizing the criteria

### the defaults

Configurable stacking criteria allows for the customization of how files are grouped
The default in pretty json is:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "originalFileName",
    "split": {
      "key": ".",
      "index": 0 // this is the default
    }
  },
  {
    "key": "localDateTime"
  }
]
```

Functionally, this JSON config transforms to the following. 

```python
lambda x: (
  x["originalFileName"].split(".")[0],
  x["localDateTime"]
)
```

The first criteria is the filename without the extension. The second criteria is the datetime of creation. This criteria aims to stack RAW+JPG images from cameras. By strippig the extension you get identical name and datetime that determine a stack.

### Basic customization of the criteria

To override the default, pass a new criteria by using the CRITERIA env var.

```shell
# From
docker -e CRITERIA='[{"key": "originalFileName", "split": {"key": ".", "index": 0}},{"key": "localDateTime"}]' ...
# To
docker -e CRITERIA='[{"key": "originalFileName", "split": {"key": "_", "index": 0}}]' ...
```

This is the equivalent of: 

```python
lambda x: (
  x["originalFileName"].split("_")[0]
)
```

### REGEX customization of the criteria

The parser also supports regex, which adds a lot more flexibility.
The index will select a substring using `re.match.group(index)`. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "originalFileName",
    "regex": {
      "key": "([A-Z]+[-_]?[0-9]{4}([-_][0-9]{4})?)([\\._-].*)?\\.[\\w]{3,4}$",
      "index": 1 // this is the default
    }
  },
  {
    "key": "localDateTime"
  }
]
```

## Parent priority

By default, `jpg`, `jpeg`, and `png` files are prioritized to be the parent. The parent is the first asset in a stack and it's the one to show first when you click on a stacked item in your timeline. 

The defaults are `jpg`, `jpeg`, and `png` because they often contain the finished image. That is especially true for systems that add filters/recipes/in-camera edits or simple profile corrections, on top of the final image.

Keywords can be provided to provide additional weight to files when sorting. Maybe you performed an edit that should show first or there is an HDR version of the image. For example:

```shell
docker -e PARENT_PROMOTE="edit,crop,hdr" ...
```

This will sort like this:

```txt
IMG_1234_hdr_crop.jpg   # score -102
IMG_1234_crop.jpg       # score -101
IMG_1234.jpg            # score -100
IMG_1234_edit_crop.raw  # score -2
IMG_1234.raw            # score 0
```

## Running tests

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t immich-auto-stack-pytest .
docker run immich-auto-stack-pytest
```
